# My personal design portfolio site in Jekyll
This is my personal portfolio website built in Jekyll. I decided on it as it's the goto pages generator that powers github and it's super fast once there are no databases or server side scripting only plain html files


## Dependencies
- Ruby
- Jekyll

## Install
1. run '''bundle install'''
2. run '''jekyll serve'''
