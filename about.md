###Experience
I have been working with web design since 1998. During this time I have worked on a wide variety of projects and products of different sizes located around the globe in a range of industries, including digital agencies, dynamic startups and big high profile brands such as Vodafone, Telecom (now Spark), Toyota, V (energy drink), Westpac and much more. 

I have a broad range of skills ranging from high level product strategy and design to implementation and coding. I'm a design graduate, hold a Marketing MBA, 2015 Techstars Alumni and self taught coder.

I've managed teams of designers, developers and copywriters with different cultural backgrounds upskilling people from the most junior roles all the way up to head of design positions.

###Services
I work on a variety of different projects including (but not limited to):

- Product strategy and design
- Application UX & UI design
- Manage multidisciplinary teams and upskill people
- Rapid prototyping on framer.js, XCode, marvel and invision
- iOS & Android application design and development
- Web design and development (Rails, Silverstripe, Wordpress and Jekyll)
- Frontend development (html, css, javascript)

###Approach
I believe the most important factors to create great products are talent and passion. I'm passionate about health, education, sustainability, communities, empowering minorities and small businesses. Whenever I can, I try to find like-minded clients and partners to join forces and solve real world problems in those areas.
