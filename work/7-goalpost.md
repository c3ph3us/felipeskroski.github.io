Goalpost uses the power of social networks, game mechanics and medical research to help people become smoke-free. It is a 12-week ‘game’ with challenges and support along the way, helping users to stay motivated throughout the quit process.

###The 12 week program

The user is kept on track throughout the course with tips, tasks, challenges and rewards, encouraging self-efficacy and breaking old habits and emotional dependencies.

###Panic button

Users who are struggling with a strong craving can press the ‘panic button’. An alert will go out to the Goalpost community prompting support, ideas for sitting out the craving & positive peer pressure to resist it.

###Community support

The Goalpost community includes others in the process of quitting, people who have successfully finished the programme, family and friends who are supporting them, and experts providing ongoing advice and motivation.


###Rehab
Users who have given into their craving have the support of the ‘rehab’ feature. They can sign up for a challenge to help get back on track by remaining smoke-free for the next 3 days with support & tips along the way.
