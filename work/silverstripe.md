Worked at SilverStripe for 3 years as design director.
During that time I:

- Created a strong design culture at the company
- Managed designers and front-end developers
- Managed all the user centric disciplines
- Lead the UI design of SilverStripe 3 CMS and other products
- Lead the design of many web sites and apps
- Redesigned logo and branding

Here's a sample of some in-house work during the time.
